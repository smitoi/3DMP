#### I just watched the GIF until I understood. It was a lot of trial and error because I had no reference.
#### The end result is a little different because I cut what I considered to be useless material.

### 2. Add joints and create a motion study:

### 3. Add appearances and render the mechanism (upload a rendering photo to GitHub as well):
<img src = "imgs/mech_wheel_png.png" alt="mech_wheel_png" width="600"/>

### BONUS: Design the evolution door following 2-7 steps from the homework tasks.

I tried to make the door, but it doesn't actually move (I played with the joints, but it just glitches)
