The end result should look like this:

### 1. Checkpoint (water-drop-old.f3d):

* 1. Divide your project into components ✔️
* 2. Start sketching and creating the objects ✔️

### 2. Checkpoint (water-drop-mech.f3d):
#### I tried to model it only using the canvases that I made in homework 6. It didn't go well. While trying to add joints I figured out that I should start over and measure the objects before I create them.
#### Even with measurements made on paper, I had some problems with the circles (fixed them quickly using some tricks).

* 1. Finish creating all objects ✔️
* 2. Add working joints 🔘
* 3. Add appearance ✔️

### 3. Checkpoint:

* 1. Start the design from the canvases created by yourself for Homework no. 6. ✔️
* 2. Save multiple versions and suggestively name them. ✔️
* 3. Properly use and name bodies, components, joints, construction, planes, etc. ✔️
* 4. Render the object applying appearance and scene. 🔘
* 5. Save the renderings as photos and as a turntable Render. 🔘
* 6. Add joints, motion links and joints limits. 🔘
* 7. Create motion studies. 🔘
* 8. The mechanism needs to work properly! 🔘
