# Final Project - Water Drop Mechanism (Rapid Prototyping) 

For my final project I had to model a Water Drop Mechanism using what I learned during the semester. The end resuls should look and work like [this (Water Experiment)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqzjAmPFND8) or [this (A Drop of Water)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Hv85T7mbnE). 

Below are gifs that I recorded from Fusion, some rendered photos and videos, the mechanism in Prusa Slicer, the checkpoints that I had to reach, with my explanations added near the end, and the resources that I used to make this project.

### 1. Checkpoint (water-drop-old.f3d):

* 1. Divide your project into components ✔️
* 2. Start sketching and creating the objects ✔️

### 2. Checkpoint (water-drop-mech.f3d):

* 1. Finish creating all objects ✔️
* 2. Add working joints 🔘
* 3. Add appearance ✔️

### 3. Checkpoint:

* 1. Start the design from the canvases created by yourself for Homework no. 6. ✔️
* 2. Save multiple versions and suggestively name them. ✔️
* 3. Properly use and name bodies, components, joints, construction, planes, etc. ✔️
* 4. Render the object applying appearance and scene. 🔘
* 5. Save the renderings as photos and as a turntable Render. 🔘
* 6. Add joints, motion links and joints limits. 🔘
* 7. Create motion studies. 🔘
* 8. The mechanism needs to work properly! 🔘

#### Explanations: 
* For checkpoint 2 I tried to model it only using the canvases that I made in homework 6. While trying to add joints I figured out that I should start over and measure the objects before I create them. Even with measurements in Fusion, and some calculations made on paper, I had some problems with the circles (fixed them quickly using some tricks with the sketches).

### Resources used:
* 3DMP Courses & Labs from Ana & Corina
* [Reddit](http://reddit.com/r/fusion360)
* [draw.io](draw.io) to draw the meachanism
* [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqzjAmPFND8) video as a reference
