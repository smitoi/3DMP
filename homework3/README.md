# Homework 3

### 1. Design a chess piceses set using the SVG sketch.
#### Note: Each piece was disconnected into smaller parts, so I added some extra lines in the SVG to connect them.
#### Other ideas could have been to do each piece and combine them (using combine or extrude).

### 2. Slice all the pieces in PrusaSlicer (Estimated printing time of a set: 7h 30m)
#### Note: The SVG is scaled to be 2.5 bigger than the original imported version
#### The pieces are between 4 cm (Pawn) and 7 cm (King)

### BONUS: Make the board as well, add appearance:
#### Note: I made each square, a thing that was not a great idea in the long run (a lot of different bodies), but the end results looks nice
