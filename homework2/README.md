# Homework 1

### 1. Download a model from Thingiverse and modify it. Slice it for 3D printing and make a screenshot of the slicer window with the sliced object and the selected option. Think of an useful improvement. If youâ€™re happy with the new design, upload it as a remix of the original.

I downloaded a model (a puzzle from the TV show Westworld) and made it two-faced. Then I sliced it.
